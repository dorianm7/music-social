# Components Introduction

## Basic Folder 
Holds the most basic components

## Forms Folder
Holds the forms used throughout the app

## ModalContents Folder
Holds the contents that will be placed inside a _Modal_.  
Placing _ModalContents_ in a _Modal_ through its _contents_ prop is **preferred** compared
to using its own premade _Modal_ component.  

## Modals Folder
Holds the modals used throughout the App.  
It is **easier** to switch the content of the modal through the _contents_
prop **rather** than rendering a new _Modal_ since components displaying a modal are wrapped with the _ModalContainer_ HOC.  
The _ModalContainer_ HOC uses a **singular** _Modal_ displaying the contents passed through its _contents_ prop making it
easier than closing and rendering a new _Modal_ each time content needs to be changed.

## Subcomponents Folder
Holds components specifically used to help create other components.
